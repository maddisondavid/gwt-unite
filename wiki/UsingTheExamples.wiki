== Introduction ==
GWT-Unite currently ships with two examples :
 # HelloWorld - A VERY basic bare bones Hello World Service
 # Blog - A GWT-Unite version of the blog application outlined in the Opera Unite developers primer

The following sections explain how to get these examples up and running. 

== Eclipse Setup ==
When working with GWT projects inside Eclipse I always find it easier to have a User library which points to the GWT files.  With this in mind, a User library called GWT is required in order to work with the GWT-Unite example projects.

The following steps show how to set up this library:

 # Go to Windows -> Preferences and search for User Libraries
 # Click New and enter GWT as the library name
 # Click on the new library and click Add Jars
 # Go to your GWT 1.7 installation and select:
	* gwt-dev-[windows|unix].jar
	* gwt-servlet.jar
	* gwt-user.jar

== Compiling and running the examples ==
As with any library/framework, it's always easier to understand with a quick example.  Here's how to compile the example services (and get a framework develop your own services).

Importing the Examples project :
	# Download the GWTUniteExamples project zip
	# File -> Import..
	# Existing Projects Into Workspace
	# Archive File -> GWTUniteExamples.zip

Compiling the Hello World Service :
	# Right click on build-helloworld.xml
	# Select Run As -> Ant Build
	# This will build dist/GWTUniteHelloWorld.us
	# Drag this file onto your Opera 10.10 installation to install it
	# The browser page will show "Hello World"
