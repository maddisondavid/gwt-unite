== What is GWT-Unite? ==

Opera Unite is a personal web server platform built into the next version of the Opera Browser (V10.10).  Services for the WebServer are built using JavaScript which, while being a good choice for a browser, doesn't lend well to building big applications.  GWT unite allows you to build Opera Unite services using GWT, and hence build your services directly in Java rather than JavaScript.

== Requirements ==
 * GWT-Unite was developed against GWT version 1.7
 * The documentation for GWT Unite assumes some experience with GWT
 * Eclipse IDE is required in order to work with the examples

== Opera Unite Supported API's ==
The current version of GWT Unite supports the following API's:
	* Core Opera Unite Library
	* Opera Widget
	* Opera O/I File
	* Markuper API *_(in progress)_*
