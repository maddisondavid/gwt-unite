## Overview ##
GWT-Unite is a library/framework which allows [Opera Unite](http://www.operaunite.com) applications to be written using the Google Web Toolkit.

In short, it allows you to **build Opera Unite applications in Java**!

## Status ##
GWT-Unite has just release version 1.0, with the following Opera Unite features :

  * Core Opera Unite Library
  * Opera Widget
  * Opera File I/O
  * Service Discovery
  * JUnit Style testing framework

## What's Next? ##
Version 2 is almost complete and now in testing.  It includes the following features:

  * RPC, fully compatible with standard GWT RPC (see [RPC](RPC.md) for a quick preview
  * Cookie support
  * Several Commons utility classes

It was hoped that a templating system (such as JSP) would be added for V2, however I think RPC is an important step forward and didn't want to delay getting it out!
