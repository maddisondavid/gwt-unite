This project isn't really part of GWT-Unite

It's simply the framework of a standard OperaUnite javascript based service.  I use it to build JavaScript test cases when a part of the Opera Unite API doesn't appear to work.
If it really IS a problem with Opera Unite the test case can be added to the bug report and
(hopefully) mean the bug is fixed quicker!
